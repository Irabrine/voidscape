                A refreshing sleep yet again.<br>Other me guessed that we would have a seafood pizza, it was a BBQ chicken pizza.<br>Don’t know why that’s bothering me more than the fact that there’s a clone of myself out there, one that apparently has my mind.<br>I’m not sure what I'm supposed to do now.<br>The threat on my life is neutralised by other Sara, or so I assume.<br>She unleashed a creature from a horror video game onto the world and has the blood of tens of people on her hands.<br>And I’m jobless.<br>That last one doesn’t matter at this point.<br>But what am I supposed to do? Go track that monstrosity and fix what other Sara did?<br>I let out a long sigh.<br>I’m just trying to avoid the obvious.<br>I finally sat upright.<br>I have to track down myself and understand what the actual fuck is happening.<br>Since when were clones a thing?<br>And how is there one of myself?<br>And most importantly, how could she cause so many deaths?<br>I go out for a run around the neighbourhood to collect my thoughts.<br>Afterwards, I take a shower and start making breakfast.<br>They’re all still asleep and I want to thank them for yesterday.<br>Meanwhile, I put on the news report and unsurprisingly enough, there’s nothing out of the ordinary.<br>If I want to dig out information, I’ll have to go to a specialist.<br>Although, I struggle to imagine a way that monster can be hidden from the public.

                The girls wake up and we have breakfast together.<br>They seem to like my take on french cuisine so that makes me a bit happy.<br>After a while, I bid them goodbye and leave.<br>Next stop, Abandoned District.<br>It’s a bit harder to manoeuvre through the tight spaces with a car so I park a bit further than usual.<br>I don’t wait around for N, I head straight to the warehouse.<br>Full of purpose, I go through the fancy manor aiming to the office space to use their computer system.<br>With the above and beyond the state of the art machine I’m provided and resources I assume they’ll have, I think I can figure out a way to track my clone.<br>I sit at one of the less personalised and turned off desks and see if it’s open without a password.<br>When I do so, the screens automatically turn on displaying an OS I don’t recognise, and in profile selection, it only has one with my name on it.<br>This comes hardly as a surprise but it makes me think.<br>It’s either an extremely creepy system which at this point is expected, or since my clone mentioned N, she might’ve beaten me to the punch and used this machine.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“Don’t worry, the profile is new and unused, your clone wasn’t recognised by the system,”</em> says a rough but kind voice from behind me.<br><em>“I see, so she tried to, meaning we think the same way but how di-”<br></em>Before I could finish my thought, I jumped off my seat pulling the stun gun out of my belt and aimed it at the figure that was leaning over my shoulder.<br><em>“Oh, sorry, did I startle you?”<br></em>There stands what I can only describe as a mighty man wearing a butler uniform.<br>A figure that the best of athletes would only hope to achieve, and a face that vibrates kindness and warmth.<br>A sight so unexpectedly charming that I let down my guard slightly.<br>His wait for a response snaps me back to my senses as I raise my gun back at him.<br><em>“Who are you?”</em> I calmly ask him.<br>I am the intruder, after all, I don’t think I have the right to get angry.<br><em>“Ah, it’s been so long, I forgot my manners.”<br></em>He raises his hand to his chest and lowers his head a little.<br><em>“I’m the caretaker of this manner, Teresh.”<br></em>I lower my gun and ask, <em>“why haven’t I seen you the few times I’ve been here?”<br>“Because you didn’t require my services,”</em> he says as he looks up with a gentle smile.<br><em>“And now I do?”<br></em>I put back the gun in my belt holster.<br>It’s just courtesy at this point, I’m a guest here after all and he could have attacked me when I wasn’t aware of his presence.<br><em>“Well, you are trying to use a brand new system I’m familiar with, given the urgency of the matter, I thought you’d appreciate some help.”<br></em>Hmm.<br><em>“What do you know?”<br>“Well, I wasn’t interested in your clone situation to look into it but Sora released a Leklensar we didn’t even know existed in the city so I’ve been looking into some things.”</em>

                He’s speaking in a very refined manner while getting a chair to sit next to me.<br>I instinctively take my seat and listen carefully to what he’s got to say.<br>I don’t know why, but it feels like I'm a student again in elementary school trying to learn things I barely understand.<br>Why did I take a liking to this guy so quickly when I barely moved around in Lizzy’s house without a gun in hand?<br><em>“As you guessed she did try to come here but the security system didn’t let her in.”<br></em>I don’t even know what he did but he pulled up footage of when the clone tried to get in.<br>But through a different door?<br>There’s a secret entrance in one of the storage containers.<br>How did she know that when I don’t?<br>Wait, what do we share to begin with?<br>I don’t know how a clone works.<br>As I’m realising this, I look at Teresh with the most puzzled of looks.<br><em>“Ah,”</em> he lets out a small giggle, <em>“I don’t know how she knows about that door either, the only things she should share with you are memories from four days ago and prior.”<br>“Aaaah, I see.”<br></em>Not only do I feel like a child, apparently I act like one too.<br><em>“Naturally, that was a red flag, but the mistress was busy with other matters so Sora went unfollowed.”<br>“Sora?”</em> I ask out of curiosity.<br><em>“We can’t have her taint your name, can we now?”<br>“That’s fair.”<br></em>About as much as I expected.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                He continues to brief me on what happened which was basically, Sora is systematically taking out anyone involved in the project and along the way releasing something that I previously thought was a science fiction alien and the only thing the manor can afford is a cleanup team.<br>I guess that would be the child with inhuman emotions and precision.<br>Speaking of the creature, I should probably ask about that.<br><em>“Um, what was that creature I saw, was it an alien?”<br></em>He looks at me with the kindest of smiles and tells me,<em> “you’d think so wouldn’t you, but no, he’s as terrestrial as you and as natural as a cat.”<br>“How?”<br>“Look at it this way, humans barely know sea creatures, the Leklensar aren’t supposed to be on the surface, they live hundreds of kilometres underground as part of the crust of the earth itself, humans simply haven’t discovered them yet.”<br>“Clearly, we should have? How is that thing being kept secret? Even when it’s rampaging as we speak?”<br>“Any digital footprint be it a video or distressed message about it is being taken care of by a System, and for witnesses, I don’t think those who survive will be believed by anyone since security cameras show nothing of the sort.”<br>“But, I saw it through security footage.”<br>“That’s because you were meant to see it.”<br>“You lost me.”<br>“Don’t worry about it for now, the question is, what will you do now?”<br>“Well, I’d like to talk with Sora but, is there a way I can deal with the creature? The Lekestan or whatever it’s called.”<br>“A Leklensar, and are you sure that’s what you want to do? It’s extremely dangerous.”<br>“It’s out there killing innocent people and no one’s doing anything about it, and I’m directly involved, so of course I’m sure.”<br></em>He gives a gentle nod and stands up.<br><em>“There’s only a single weapon you’re qualified for that can take it down, but you’ll have to be extremely careful.”<br></em>I answer with silence.<br><em>“Very well, hand me your gun.”<br></em>I hesitate but push myself to give it to him.<br>He’s already better equipped than myself, so there’s nothing to worry about right?<br><em>“Make sure you hit it above the base where his legs meet, doesn’t matter which side, just don’t hit the armoured base,”</em> he says as he’s fiddling with the gun.<br><em>“You’ll find what you’re looking for in the coordinates in your car,”</em> he says as he hands me the gun back.<br><em>“Thank you.”<br></em>A sincere thank you comes from the bottom of my heart, and I head out.<br>He just stays where he stood and watches me leave.<br>Hunting an unknown monster on a rampage while a clone of myself is on a murderous spree.<br>Not how I thought this month was going to go.

                Having time to think during the drive to my location, I’m starting to realise that that interaction just then should not have felt as natural as it did.<br>Random guy appears in the most dangerous place I’ve ever stepped foot in and starts giving me a lecture, and I take it at face value.<br>I didn’t even ask about what that place is or where’s N or what’s with that whole armoury.<br>I think it was the tone of his mannerism.<br>I’ll have to keep that in mind for next time so I can get actual answers and not just a  distraction like giving candy to a child.<br>For now, I'll have to focus on the destination ahead.<br>I park by the entrance to the desert biodome.<br>The desert one is usually the least popular, but it should have a few thousand people around at least, making this scene a bit unusual.<br>The parking lot is empty if not for my car and one more.<br>It should be filled with tourists and regulars.<br>I see, the current weather inside is a Silicon Storm.<br>That would seem normal to anyone who didn’t work on the system that governs this dome.<br>Silicon Storms happen in an oddly specific manner as far as weather goes; and it shouldn’t happen for a few months, meaning, someone deliberately messed with the weather broadcast.<br>Doesn’t hurt to check, if there was an actual storm going on, my motorcycle gear should be able to handle it for a few hours maybe.

                I wear my leather gear and I go through the tunnel underground to get to the airlock into the dome.<br>Past the airlock, and to my surprise, the almost completely invisible grains of sand are hitting me.<br>An out of season storm like this is quite unusual and doesn’t bode well for me.<br>I follow whatever direction my helmet tells me to follow, from inside the dome, it’s like there’s nothing but said biome, so my reference of location is non-existent.<br>Takes me about 40 minutes to see what I’m aiming for.<br>The creature has its base on the ground and its legs burrowed deep and its arms in the air.<br>In front of it is the figure of a sitting woman whom I recognise.<br>I walk up next to her and stare at the massive horrifying creature, but it doesn’t invoke fear, only caution and adrenaline.

                <em>“You sure you want to be here?"</em> She says with a voice filled with… Sadness?<br><em>“That’s what I’m here to ask you.”<br></em>The same way I could tell what she’s feeling from her tone, I’m sure she knows how much drive I have.<br><em>“It’ll all be over soon, just a few more hours and it’ll be back where it belongs.”<br>“In a few hours, you’ll be dead from blood loss.”<br></em>She’s bleeding multiple puncture wounds all over her body, a mask was the only protection she had getting to the eye of the storm.<br><em>“As long as it gets back home, I’m okay with that.”<br></em>The amount of truthfulness in that sentence scares me.<br><em>“You’re willing to die for a monster?”</em> I ask calmly.<br><em>“It’s no monster, it’s just an animal, the only monster here is me.”<br></em>Despair and dread filled that one.<br><em>“Elaborate?”<br>“It only kills out of need and fear; I killed out of choice, it attacked those whom I decided it should attack.”<br></em>I can only respond with silence.<br><em>“I’ve done many things we never thought we’d be able to do in the past four years.”<br></em>More silence.<br><em>“At first it was for survival, but then it became more than that, I started enjoying it, that’s where my downfall started. Without someone to guide me, I became the very thing I was hunting.”<br></em>I don’t know how to react to this, I don’t know what happened to her or how, but I can tell that she believes every word she’s saying, and she has a lot of hate in store for herself but sees hope in myself.<br>Aren’t we the same person?<br>Weren’t you created four days ago?<br>I wanted to ask these questions but I couldn’t talk, only listen.<br><em>“I would only go for those marked, but somehow before I knew it, I myself was marked.”<br></em>We share a moment of silence.<br><em>“What happened next?”</em> I ask her with pity, at this point I’m not on guard, my adrenaline died down and the creature seems so peaceful that even I felt it.<br><em>“I didn’t care and kept on doing what I was doing.”<br>“But then…”<br>“Then Elizabeth, Sophie and Lyre got dragged into my world. As you could guess, Elizabeth died within the first 12 hours, the Lux sisters in 43.”<br></em>My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.<br><em>“That snapped me back to what I was, broken, full of hate for those who killed them, and most importantly myself for letting it get to that point, I had to redeem myself… but of course, I knew I was unforgivable. At that point I couldn’t handle the pain, I wanted to die, but couldn’t…”<br>…<br>“I had to live with the knowledge that I cause so much despair in the world, but then I was offered an out, help this little fellow go back home”<br>“You’re not a clone are you.”</em> The only emotion I can get out of my voice is pity, not my curiosity or surprise, the only thing I could express to her is how much I pity her.<br><em>“Generally clones die in their first 48 hours, where I come from anyway, they only last for 4 hours here, don’t get me wrong I’m still you, just… you that seen corrosion.”<br></em>Nero.<br><em>“I went for a last hunt when I got here to clear out those who held this animal in torment, I could feel what it feels… you know, accepting the deal meant I would feel the dread of not only myself, but its as well.”<br>“Where did you go so wrong?”<br>“You won’t need to worry about that, you’ll have a better run than me… just… love Lizzy… love Sophie… love Lyre…”<br></em>Not really sure how I’m supposed to react to any of this.

                With that, the creature suddenly burrows into the sand, disappearing without a trace, like a two-sided drill.<br>She starts petting a grey cat on her lap that then jumps and walks away.<br>Grey cat.<br>She stands up and looks at me.<br><em>“And now for my reward, if I may see that stun gun of yours, I believe it’s been modified.”<br></em>I hand her the gun.<br>I would say it’s not a smart idea but there’s nothing I can do… this is what I was supposed to do.
