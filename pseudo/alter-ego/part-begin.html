                I wake up from the strange dream refreshed. I checked my phone to see that it’s 9 in the morning, I slept for nearly 10 hours it seems.<br>I’m still drowsy from sleep, but that instantly goes away when I look at my bedside table. There’s a small orange case that I don’t recognise.<br>Adrenaline is being pumped, I jump off the bed rushing to my gun. I walk around the house at the ready looking for whoever intruded, but there is no one, only the remnant of their visit. While I’m looking I check the front door and windows but there doesn’t seem to be any sign of broken entry, if anything, nothing is changed throughout the apartment except for that case by my bed.<br>My heart doesn’t calm down as my body is fully energised but I feel calm, this isn’t the situation I would’ve wanted to get used to but I have nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Going back to the case, I open it to find stacks of money, and a weird small metal ball that has a few different sized rods coming out of it, the entire thing is the size of my hand, I think it’s supposed to be a key? The ball seems to be the handle, and in blue, the number ‘1’ is marked on it.<br>What is this case? Why would someone give me money and a key I don’t quite understand. Just how much money is this anyway?<br>Each stack seems to be 10,000 vals in cash. So someone left me 80,000 vals in cash and a key. Under the money, I find an envelope with nothing written on it. Opening it, I find a strange credit card, with no name or number, or even a bank logo, along with a letter.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“Time to buckle up My Dear Aurae, you’re unfortunate enough to be fortunate enough for life itself to call your name. Come to my lair, it’ll be a safe haven for you.<br>~N”</em>
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I’m not sure if I should feel relieved that N was the one that broke into my house. I try not to think too hard about it.<br>I let out a long sigh and go to the kitchen where I make myself eggs on toast. I eat it right there and then before going back to my room where I pick up my backpack and the USB that works as a backdoor to the lab’s network.<br>I get on my motorcycle and head off to the abandoned district in the edges of the commercial district.<br>Am I really going to stay at N’s? That may not be the grandest of options but it’s my only one. I can’t stay at Lizzy’s or the Lux’s since I don’t want to involve them. This is a gamble I’m willing to take.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I get off at the usual spot where I usually meet him, but there’s no one to greet me today.<br>I sit on my bike waiting for him to show up. Half an hour passes, I don’t think he’s going to meet me today.<br>If I’m supposed to figure out where his ‘lair’ would be, it’s probably the huge closed off warehouse in the middle of the district.<br>I ride up to it and circle it slowly looking for an entrance, but there’s a certain lack of those; you would think that a warehouse would have more than a single entrance, but all I found was a mahogany door?<br>…<br>What?<br>Sorry, but why is there a shiny mahogany door of all things in this rundown warehouse?<br>And wouldn’t you know it, it has a strangely shaped keyhole.<br>I insert the weird key I received this morning, and unsurprisingly it fits perfectly, turning into the door handle.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I step into what feels like the interior of a large mansion, a shiny marble floor carpeted with a beautifully designed piece, mahogany furniture everything, from displays to tables to cabinets, all showing something special, art pieces, statuettes, large gems. I feel like I walked into a parallel universe and I’m at some billionaire’s humble home, and I’m just standing in the entrance hall mystified by the scene in front of me.<br>I close the door behind me and walk around the place in hopes of finding someone.<br><em>“Hello?... Is anybody there?”<br></em>I look around expecting an answer but no response to be heard.<br>I go into a large living room as it’s the first doorway from the door, other than the prestige sofas and tables, there’s also a piano by the fireplace, and other instruments behind it.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I put my backpack and helmet on the table and start exploring the first floor. There’s an impressive gallery, a huge storage room, multiple bathrooms, a dining hall, a fully equipped kitchen, a walk-in fridge with more types of food than I have ever seen, and get this, an entire indoors garden, I mean this thing is HUGE, there are full-sized trees here and a small farm with various crops growing. The room is artificially lit but if I didn’t know we were indoors I wouldn’t notice the difference without looking at the artificial sky for too long.<br>What did I walk into?<br>I go back to the entrance hallway and walk up the large staircase to see what’s upstairs.<br>Walking around, I find a hallway that feels like a hotel. There are 8 rooms with a different type of door than the rest of the place. I check them to see that they’re big bedrooms, each with their bathroom, and a minifridge. As I’m checking the rooms one by one, just peering quickly into them to see if they’re the same as the first one I went into, three of them are locked, the other rooms had keys inside but all of them were unlocked, and they didn’t seem to be used, so I assume that these ones are being used. But the last room, that one is unlocked, but it’s different from the other bedrooms. Being the furthest down the hall of bedrooms I thought it would be another bedroom but it isn’t, it’s a server room.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Why is there a server room in the personal quarters of the warehouse?<br>Also, this is starting to feel a little bit bigger than a mansion, granted I’ve only been to one mansion but even that’s small compared to this place.<br>I continue looking around the floor to find a big office space, it’s like a living room but with four desks gathered at one side, it looks kind of nice until you look over at the ominous wall.<br>Three layers of four screens hang on a wall, ten of the twelve screens display various parts of the abandoned district switching between points of view, while the two middle bottom ones just over the weird keyboard interface display several options, but what catches my attention is the slightly bigger bold font saying “No Threat Detected”.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Continuing to look around the second floor, I find what I can only describe as the entertainment room, it’s like a gorgeous pristine bar but with numerous games, there’s a bowling strip, a few arcade games, a large screen, a pool table, and a larger table with a shelf next to it with stacks of board games. This might be my favourite room in the warehouse. Seeing this room reduces the tension I’ve been feeling up to this point even if just by a little bit.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Now, only one more thing to explore, the basement. Just thinking about it makes my muscles tense up.<br>I go back down to the first floor and stand in front of the small door leading to stairs going downwards.<br>I have a bad feeling about this. Walking down the long staircase, I find myself in front of another door, a metallic one that doesn’t match the style of the rest of the place.<br>I press the flat metal button on the wall, the door slides open and the brightness of the room blinds me for a moment.<br>As my eyes adjust to the light, I peer into a gargantuan room with metal display cases and shelves everywhere, on the ground, by the walls, hanging on the walls, from the ceiling, I’m not even sure how you can reach the three layers above ground. It looks to me as if this place covers more space than the entire warehouse upstairs which boggles my mind.<br>I walk slowly to see what’s in these displays. These rows by the entrance all seem to have large gemstones. I stand in front of a display case showing a huge ruby, the interface attached to the case says there are 306 rubies.<br>It says that the required privilege is 1 and I want to see if I can open it, so I press the open button on the interface.<br>The glass slides in giving me access to its treasure.<br>I pick up the ruby and immediately the glass closes it again, then the case’s floor slides open and another ruby is elevated to replace the one I took and the number displayed is reduced by one.<br>You’re telling me that there are 305 more rubies this big in this case?<br>I put the ruby inside the insert slot at the bottom and the number is increased by one.<br>So I at least have privilege one for some reason.<br>I move a little further down the line to see what else is here. I’m no longer in the gems isles but it’s still just weird materials I don’t recognise, all but one.<br>There’s a lump of black mould being displayed. This is that stuff I bought from N for a ludicrous amount of money.<br>According to the interface, this is ‘Feiro Brain Extract’ that was retrieved from the hunt of 2026 in Belgium.<br>I’m a tad bit confused so I’m going to ignore it and hope I’ll get an explanation from N if he ever shows up.<br>It’s getting more and more unsettling as I walk through this facility.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Now there’s a bunch of devices on display, I have never seen most of these and have no idea what they are, and even the ones I recognise, I only vaguely remember them from reading up on scientific research and how some dangerous experimentation was done.<br>Why would anyone need all of this though? I don’t get it.<br>Getting past the gadget section, I find myself in an armoury segment.<br>There are all kinds of weapons on display; swords, knives, guns, you name it. And it’s not limited to traditional, I’m standing in front of what I can only describe as a futuristic rifle with the required privilege nine. I try to open it just so I can see what my privilege level is, and it’s denied me access as expected. I wanted to read the description of this gun but it’s written in a language I don’t understand.<br>I reach a large display cabinet, and inside, is a huge missile.<br>The interface says it’s an SCT-14, a bomb with a contained radius of 14.6km of absolute annihilation.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I shouldn’t be here.<br>This is a bad idea.<br>It’s too dangerous to stay.<br>I run out of the storage facility, up the stairs, through the main door, onto my motorcycle, and out of the district.<br>I had to leave as fast as I could.<br>I have to stay away for as long as I can.
