                There I stood, shovel in hand, it seems that I’m out of shock and the empress arrived. Not sure why your highness is judging me, you knew this is how it was going to end, my death was only natural, you guessed so the moment I woke up, the very minute the cat dragged me in, I was a dead girl walking.

                I wake up to the annoying beeping of my phone. Slowly raising my head, I pick up my phone to see that it’s 8:07 in the morning and there’s a barrage of messages from none other than my best friend, Elizabeth.<br><em>“Also, don't forget we’re meeting at Zareich’s Cafe at 10.”<br></em>I let out a long sigh as I assure her I’ll be there.<br>Guess it’s time to start the day.<br>I get up and change into my sportswear, get down on the yoga mat, and start exercising.<br>Half an hour later, I take a shower and dress up in casual clothes, jeans and a plain crimson shirt, nothing fancy.<br>I get a bowl of cereal and eat while watching an anime.<br>An hour later, I picked up my gun and wallet from the drawer, putting the gun on my belt holster and covering it with my shirt, while putting my wallet in my back pocket.<br>Picking up my keys and helmet on my way out, I walk out of my flat.<br>I get on my yellow-striped black motorcycle and the wall claw holding it lets go and retracts back into the wall.<br>It takes me ten minutes to get to the large square. I park in front of a large coffee house in the shape of a large villa. I walk in and take my usual seat on a sofa upstairs in the corner near a window where I can look out at the large square and its gardens and beautiful aesthetic shops.

                Half an hour passes and two familiar cars park in front of the cafe.<br><em>“Saraaaa! Sorry, we’re late!”<br></em>I can’t see her yet but I can feel the walking storm approaching from beyond the stairs. All I can do is watch and accept my fate.<br>My short chubby friend runs up the stairs and quite literally lunges at me expecting me to catch her, and catch her I did.<br><em>“Careful with the table Lizzy!”<br></em>Following her are the sisters, Lyre and Sophie, still wearing their tracksuits.<br><em>“Lizzy, behave yourself, people are having breakfast!”<br></em>Lyre scolds Elizabeth with a harsh tone, you’d think she’d be used to it by now but she still tries.<br><em>“So, how was the match?”<br></em>I look up at the sisters while adjusting Lizzy to sit properly; after years of knowing her, it just sort of becomes the norm.<br><em>“Was pretty good, Sophie fell badly… but I feel bad for the ground more than I do for her, she just walked it off.”<br></em>Lyre has a smile on her face while she says that<br><em>“Guess you’re moving to the finals, but what were you doing there Lizzy, watching requires you being out of your room before 9”<br></em>I look at Lizzy with the most puzzled look my face can take.<br><em>“Sophie dragged her out by force, she lost a bet last week”<br></em>Sophie and Lyre giggle as Lizzy pouts.

                We hung out for a while, when suddenly, my phone started ringing. I take a look at the caller and it’s my boss.<br><em>“Mrs Aurae, is this a good time?”<br></em>Her voice was emotionless as usual, she may ask if this is a good time but what she means with that is ‘make it a good time’.<br><em>“Wait, hold on for a moment; sorry girls I’ll be right back.”<br></em>I go into an empty balcony.<br><em>“What is it?”<br>“We’re handing you a special assignment for your eyes only, so we’ll need you to come to work on Monday and make it look like you have taken paid leave for a month.”<br>“I’m sorry?”<br>“You will not share any information about this, even the fact that you’re working on this assignment is undiscussable.”<br></em>This does not sit well with me.<br><em>“Alright, what’s all this about? We never get any special assignments that require only one of us, we work on everything together.”<br>“Given the seriousness of this assignment, we can’t have more than one person know about it and that’s not negotiable.”<br></em>She’s pushing this forcefully. I don’t like it.<br><em>“By definition, all assignments we work on are serious.”<br>“Don’t take this personally Sara, it was specified by our client that only one person is granted admittance to their facility and they’re paying double our highest rate.”<br></em>She doesn’t want to give me time to think about it, does she?<br><em>“Well, I can’t say no can I; alright, where do I go afterwards?”<br>“Come to my office, I'll give you the details then.”<br>“Alright, I’ll see you Monday morning.”<br></em>I go back to my seat.<br><em>“Is everything okay?”<br></em>Sophie seems worried, that’s nice.<br><em>“Just work, nothing to worry about.”<br></em>After a while, we all leave our separate ways and I go back home.

                Nothing particular happened during the rest of the weekend, I just did my chores, watched shows and played video games.
                </p>

                Monday morning, I wake up to my alarm, the sun has just risen and it’s time to get ready for work. I do my morning routine as per usual, exercise, shower, eat. Since I’m supposed to look like I’m taking a vacation I won’t be wearing my suit, so I’ll go with the casual clothes I wore on Saturday.<br>Leaving my home and driving for ten minutes, I reach the large business district composed of nothing but offices.<br>I walk into the office tower; I tap my security card alongside my fingerprint on the scanner by the door. The long corridor I walk through always makes me feel tingly, even after many years I never got used to it. This building alone is probably more secure than any intelligence military base in other countries.

                I take the elevator to the topmost floor and walk straight to the ‘Operations Control’ office. I knock on the door and let myself in.<br><em>“Excuse me, is this a good time?”<br></em>I cautiously walked in, my face felt stiff and didn't want to put on a smile.<br><em>“Yes, yes, do take a seat!”<br></em>My elderly boss, Clarence Coreen, wearing a full white suit, waves me to sit down, her face as expressionless as ever.<br><em>“So, about this assignment you want me to take, what is it?”<br></em>I say as if things are business as usual.<br><em>“You will be working on diagnosing every weak point in Sed Pharmaceutical Labs’ systems, you will have direct access to their servers physically and the rest is up to you.”<br>“That’s… that’s it?”<br>“It seems like a trivial job, but I want you to treat it like you’re breaking into the Lithuanian Mosaic Network.”<br></em>I don’t get why a simple diagnosis would require this.<br><em>“And what if I refuse? This job feels sketchy with how little you’re telling me and how I’m not given time to think about it.”<br>“You can’t refuse… It's time to pay your debt.”<br></em>My gut physically turns. During all the years after that incident, no job was good enough for her to force me to do it. What's different about this one?<br>I stay silent for a good minute before I speak up.<br><em>“Alright, give me the access card, ETA depends on how many holes I find on their system.”<br></em>She hands me a card that reads “Signal Interference’s S.P.L: Special Access”.<br><em>“I already announced that you’re going on paid leave, and you’ve done it before last minute so no one’s going to find it suspicious, you can just take your things and go.”<br>“What about social engineering? Was physical security already checked or are we skipping straight to cyber?”<br>“Don’t worry about that, just worry about your part.”<br></em>I put the card in my wallet and leave her office heading to my desk.

                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“Aight James, Silvia, I’ll see you in a few weeks, say hi to Mark when he gets here!”<br></em>I have a smile and relaxed look on my face, of course, it’s fake but they don’t know that. I’m merely going on a vacation, just one of Sara’s random disappearances.<br><em>“Don’t forget our souvenirs like last time.”<br>“No promises, I’m going to visit mother nature again, she doesn’t provide souvenirs.”<br></em>We giggle and they give me a cheerful nod telling me goodbye.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Once I’m back on my motorcycle, I check the card I was given for the name of the company. On my motor’s interface, I pull up the map and search for “Sed Pharmaceutical Labs”, but nothing shows up.<br><em>“Not registered in the public codex... that’s why they picked me...”<br></em>I can hear the disappointment in my voice, I can feel my heart race, I struggle to put in a code on the search bar that’s provided on my card; and after I manage to do it, a location is pinned labelled “S.P.L”
