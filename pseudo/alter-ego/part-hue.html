                I drive through the city with a blank mind.<br>This isn’t a situation I ever thought I’d be in.<br>Why would N invite me to that warehouse?<br>It doesn’t exactly feel safer than my own home.<br>Oh… I forgot, there are people after me that’s why I went there in the first place.<br>I park by the garden square I’m familiar with and sit on a bench.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Would you look at that, the world is getting blurry, people are moving faster, why does everyone have a grin on their face? Do they know something I don’t? They’re all moving with such confidence and aim in their eyes, a crystal clear goal in front of them.<br>Wait, what am I thinking? I can’t even see their faces, it’s too out of focus, and yet, I can still see them looking at me with a ravenous hunger in their eyes.<br><sub><em>“Sara?”<br></em></sub>I shrink on my bench succumbing to the pressure.<br>Was the city always this forest hunting ground?<br>Were the kind and happy people always predators ready to attack?<br>Of course they weren’t, even now they aren’t this herd of murderous beasts looking for their next target.<br><sub><em>“Sara!”<br></em></sub>I’m sure they’re normal people living a normal life far away from the world which I stepped into.<br>And yet, I can’t help but feel cornered, surrounded by people who might be involved after all.<br>If I looked at N from the outside, I would never expect him to own a basement that could start doomsday.<br>Any of these people could have secret bloodlust.<br>What’s stopping them from trying to kill me right here and now?<br>I mean sure, I trained myself for this, but I’m practically defenceless.<br>My vision is distorted and my body feels heavy; I doubt I can take on a highschooler let alone a trained assassin.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <sub><em>“Sara!!!”<br></em></sub>Oh, it seems like my vision’s coming back.<br>My blood is pumping faster.<br>My body is getting lighter and lighter.<br>My body is getting ready without telling me what it’s getting ready for.<br>Adrenaline is filling up my system.<br>I feel a hand touch my right shoulder from behind.<br><em>“Sara!”<br></em>My left hand instinctively reaches for my shoulder while my right arches back to the shoulder behind me as my entire body weight pulls on the person behind.<br>Hold on a minute, I recognise this voice.<br>I quickly put my leg between my friend and the ground before impact.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                She lets out a small scream and the people around turn to look at me holding the arm of a fallen woman on the ground.<br>Luckily, knowing Elizabeth, I won’t have to explain the situation the moment she opens her mouth.<br><em>“Blimey, that took me by surprise, not your best throw though, 4 out of 10.”<br></em>She lets out a giggle and people ignore what just happened.<br>Bless your heart, Lizzy.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“So sorry, you startled me, that wasn’t nice of me.”<br></em>Even though she’s jokey and likes getting physical, I feel guilty from throwing her down like this, as I was seconds away from knocking her out.<br><em>“I tried calling you but you didn't answer your phone.”<br></em>Still on the ground, she speaks with a kind smile on her face.<br>She picked up on my bad mood quickly.<br><em>“Oh, it seems that I left it in the living room, sorry.”<br></em>She’s intending on having this conversation fully with her laying flat on the ground, isn’t she?<br><em>“I’ve been calling for you from afar but you seemed zoned out.”<br></em>I’ve let my distraction show, I’ll have to pay attention to keep up appearances.<br><em>“Had a tough day at work, was out here to clear my mind.”<br></em>I can lie to anyone successfully but I think it’s not even worth trying with Lizzy.<br><em>“Hmm? You know it’s too early for you to be out of work.”<br></em>She knows I’m lying so she’ll either not ask about it or ask too many questions, I’m hoping for the former.<br><em>“So what are you doing in the commercial district this time of day, I thought you had a commission in the Quazi sector.”<br></em>She finally gets up.<br><em>“I took the day off to see the girls’ practice match, we just came to hang out a bit funnily enough.”<br></em>Bless your understanding heart, Lizzy.<br><em>“I see, mind if I join you?”<br>“That’s why I came to get you silly, get your bike and come on.”<br></em>This might be the thing I need the most right now.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I go back to my bike and follow up to Lizzy.<br>The world suddenly feels lighter, not as much as it used to be, but just being around her is restoring my sanity.<br>We go back to a coffee shop I’m not used to, most of us are creatures of habit so this is unusual.<br>She takes me through a narrow alleyway I never even noticed, it barely fits me and my motorcycle.<br>We stop in front of a regular wooden door without any sort of indication this is a public space.<br>I lock my bike on the wall systems and hesitantly walk in.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I’ve discovered too many things in the past 24 hours.<br>I'm anxious to walk through these doors, but I put my absolute trust in Elizabeth; this can’t be bad.<br>We walk up the dim-lit corridor and take the elevator up.<br>My heart beat increases with each second, anticipating the worst.<br>Still, with the disturbing lack of indications that this is a public environment, the elevator door opens, but as my eyes adjust to the light from the other side, I let out a long sigh of relief as I feel my body relax.<br>No military-grade weapons here, nothing to worry about.<br>We enter a huge lavish cafe, just looking at it makes me feel comfortable, it’s designed in a way that feels modern without losing the feel of a traditional layout. Simplistic and yet complex, and they even have a band playing some relaxing music playing in the background.<br>I can see Lyre and Sophie sitting in a corner by the windows. I say hi as we join them at the table and when I look out the window, the sight stuns me. All the surprises I’ve had lately were terrible, this is a good change of pace.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                We’re at a very high point looking down with a view of the entire commercial district.<br>Just how strong is Lizzy’s sense of detail? she could spot me on a bench from all the way up here while I can barely make up the shape of a person let alone identify them.<br><em>“Stunning, isn’t it?” Lyre says with a small voice yet with a tone of pride.<br>“How have we never heard of this place?”<br>“I know RIGHT?!”<br></em>Sophie’s voice increases in volume halfway through the sentence, unable to hide her surprise.<br><em>“Lyre somehow got an invitation to this place, apparently it’s super-secret.”<br></em>Elizabeth seems a bit too calm from what I expected in this situation.<br><em>“Speaking of, don’t tell or invite anyone to this place before asking the maids or butlers for permission.”<br></em>Lyre says something odd with a straight face.<br>Maids and butlers? It doesn’t look like a maid cafe, unless this is some sort of unheard of fancy place with proper maids and butlers.<br>I’ll find out soon enough.<br><em>“How do they make a profit without advertisement or even allowing people in?”<br>“Don’t know, but that’s the conditions I was given with the invite; if they don’t recognise who’s in the elevator it doesn’t come up here.”<br></em>Odd scheme, but I can see its appeal, but I don’t get how it works.<br>That doesn’t matter now, we sit and chat for the afternoon, letting my mind temporarily forget about everything that’s going on and letting myself enjoy the norm.<br>As it turns out, it actually is a super fancy place with straight faced butlers that Lizzy stares at a little too intimately.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                It’s nearing sunset, Lizzy pays for everyone before we head out.<br>After leaving the alleyway, Lizzy and I waved the sisters goodbye as we split up.<br>While walking to her car, she tried to find out what was wrong a few times but after noticing how uncomfortable I was, she decided to drop it, telling me I can always talk to her if I ever needed to.<br>I always forget how thoughtful and kind Lizzy can be if she picks up on how bad a situation is, weirdly perceptive as well.<br>I waved goodbye to her as she was heading off.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Now I’m back at my bench alone with no leads on what I should do.<br>I gathered myself and I can think more clearly, but the situation is too tangled.<br>Can’t go back to work since any moment could be my last.<br>If I’m to take N’s word, I shouldn’t go to the police either.<br>So what are my options here?<br>My life is being threatened and I don’t have enough information to work on, nor do I have somewhere to go.<br>My flat is obviously a no go, I can't stay with my friends either, I don’t want them to accidentally get involved and hurt in the process.<br>My colleagues, of course, think I’m on vacation and Clarence is to not be trusted, after all, she practically sold my life.<br><em>“A HOTEL!”<br></em>I shout out of happiness, bringing surprised looks at me for the sudden outburst.<br>I’ll go back to that madhouse to get my stuff then head to one of the hotels on the other side of the city.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Night has fallen so I better move so I can make it before I get too tired.<br>I get on my motorcycle and drive off.<br>I enter the abandoned district again and drive slowly to the warehouse.<br>I park in front of the odd door.<br>I should take the key handle thing with me when I’m leaving.<br>I went into the living room where I left my things.<br>A grey cat is sleeping on the sofa; I must’ve missed it when I was here earlier.<br>I pick up my backpack and helmet, pet the cat a little, and walk out the door.<br>I turn the doorknob anticlockwise a few times before pulling it off.<br>After putting it in my backpack, I get on my motorcycle and drive off.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Haven’t been to the other side in years, so a change of scenery might be good for me as well.<br>Fastest way there is to take the silver roads, with my bike’s max speed of 250km/h, I can get there in 4 hours.<br>The girls reminded me that I have something to fight for.<br>I’m not going to layover and accept my death.<br>Those fun times of mindless banter are blissful and what I live for.<br>It takes me a while to get to the roads, having heavy traffic on a busy Thursday night, but I reach the entrance in the end.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I go down the tunnel as it gradually changes from the normal stone into slightly metallic plates and then finally full silver platings while the road gets smoother the closer I get to the entrance junction.<br>I slip into the large network of silver tunnels.<br>This place is almost completely closed off from the outside world if it weren’t for the entrances and exits.<br>You get map information from a separate network system that’s dedicated for the tunnels only, no messages or interactions with anything outside, even the air is different, I don’t know why, but breathing it feels different, reminds me of a tropical biome dome.<br>I do appreciate that there’s provided entertainment along the way if you have an Augmented Reality helmet on, without that, I’d fall asleep with the repetitive nature of the tunnel, there aren’t even signs to indicate where you are, so it just feels like an infinite loop of black ground and solid silver walls; it’s a must-have for anyone that uses the tunnels.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                The tunnel seems to be very active but there’s always space to drive because of how big it is.<br>I pick the “Tourist” theme on my bike’s interface, and I see a Voronoi texture that forms on the silver walls and with a burst, the silver walls in front of me break like a mirror frozen in time.<br>I drive through a road around what I think is an American city in the distance.<br>This makes the four hours drive pass much faster than if I were to go through a normal boring road, this way it feels like I’m circling a city looking at various features of it, there are even people in the distance.<br>Sometime later, broken fragments of silver start appearing slowly until it closes back into the silver walls of the tunnel.<br>I was completely distracted, I forgot to check how close I was, but I’m ten minutes away.<br>I leave through my exit tunnel and slow down as the tunnel transitions to normal as I’m nearing the surface.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Next time, I should have the AR scenery match outside time and weather, because it just feels weird being in a cloudy night after enjoying 4 hours of blazing sunshine with no sunset in between.<br>I head towards a hotel, The Smiling Lavender, that I heard about from Lizzy.<br>She stayed here for a few weeks when she had a job and apparently it’s great.<br>Not like I would know, I never stayed at a hotel before, I would always rent a flat when travelling outside the city.<br>I booked a room with the money N left me and headed towards it.<br>I put my bag on the floor, my helmet on the table, and jump face-first onto the bed, falling asleep nearly instantly.

                Annoying beeping interrupts my already uncomfortable sleep.<br>I reached for my phone… maybe I should’ve stayed asleep.<br>Someone’s trying to get access to my computer so badly they triggered my logic bomb.<br>I put my phone down and go back to sleep.

                <p class="recitation">
                Wait, hold on… I don’t have mine set up to notify me.<br>Panicked, my eyes widen as I lose my sleep.<br>I check my phone again, it’s Elizabeth’s move condition.<br>I’m stunned where I sit.<br>I should have seen this coming. Why wouldn’t they go for my friends to get to me? I shouldn’t have left. I should’ve held my ground. Protect what matters to me.<br>I only have one extra magazine for my gun, but that’s all I need<br>I pick up my things and leave quickly.<br>I get on my bike and start driving even before I put a destination on my map.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Checking the map while driving, I make a sharp turn and start heading for the nearest ‘Leviathan Transport Station’.<br>The city’s pretty active but the closer I get to the Draconic Centre, the less frequently I see people.<br>In less than ten minutes, I drove into a large modern parking lot.<br>With my bike in the parking space, I interact with the panel in front of said space.<br>A black metal wall bursts forth from the ground encasing the parking space.<br>I request an immediate swap from my ‘Drake Alpha’ to a ‘Hydra Iota’, the fastest commercially available car provided by the ‘GWE’, and currently the best available way to get to Lizzy’s house.<br>It was a slight gamble, but when it came to payment, I pulled out the card that N left me and tapped it on the panel.<br>I hold my breath as it processes the transition.<br>I’ll be damned, it accepted it and it’s bringing the car. So he left me a card with at least three million vals, that’s enough to buy a luxurious mansion by the sea; I should be suspicious but all I am right now is grateful.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Waiting for it is painful.<br>I know this is the literal fastest delivery possible but I can feel my muscles twitching.<br>I want to call her but I don’t want to find out until I’m there.<br>If something did happen, it’ll only stress me more while I’m getting there so I better not.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Twenty minutes pass and suddenly the wall slides back down to reveal the sleek carbon fibre black supercar.<br>It opens the door for me and I get in.<br>My account is already connected to it, so I immediately start driving towards the Silver Roads.<br>Once I enter the admitting tunnel, I get a warning on the interface telling me to eat the provided pill?<br>A very small compartment opens with a pill inside it.<br>I pop it into my mouth and swallow.<br>I can feel myself getting more focused and aware of everything, but my body feels lighter and slightly numb.<br>I can move fine, but I only feel that I moved and nothing else.<br>Once I’m in the Silver Roads’ main tunnel, the car informs me that the speed limit has been lifted, and I accelerate to half the speed of sound in half a minute.<br>I should be feeling dizzy right now, and yet, I’m not; it must be the pill’s effect.<br>I zoom through the tunnel without activating the AR on the windscreen.<br>And in less than an hour, I reached the exit tunnel.<br>After slowing down to normal city speed, I drive through the familiar streets heading towards Elizabeth’s house.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                It’s been almost two hours since I got the message.<br>I park by the large house’s garden.<br>I slowly walk up to the door, gun at hand, ready for the worst.<br>I try to open the door as quietly as I can with my spare key.<br>The lights are turned off, but nothing seems to be out of place.<br>Slowly walking upstairs to her room with my back to the wall, I hear some noise from the bathroom; water is running.<br>I stand by the door waiting for whoever’s inside to leave.<br>The tap is turned off, I take off the safety from my pistol and ready myself.<br>The door opens and I expect the worst.<br>The moment a figure appears, I grasp them with a headlock.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                A shout is let out, a familiar one… I’m choking the half-naked Elizabeth.<br>The realisation hits me and I drop her.<br>She runs straight to her room while coughing.<br>Putting the gun on the back of my belt, I walk up to the door and knock.<br><em>“Lizzy, dear, it’s just me, Sara!”<br>“What the actual hell? Why are you attacking me?!”<br></em>I don’t like the despair in her voice, I feel like I betrayed her trust.<br><em>“I thought someone was in your house trying to attack you.”<br>“Why would you think that, since when did that become a thing that you worry about??”<br>“If you could open the door, I can explain.”<br></em>The door slowly creaked open and I saw an expression on Lizzy’s face that I don’t like seeing; a mixture of confusion and fear.<br>All words escape me, but looking at her lowers my adrenaline levels.<br>She’s okay, there’s nothing to worry about.<br>She’s safe.<br>No one attacked her and she’s here.<br>Elizabeth is fine.<br>Suddenly she wraps her hands around me and gives me a warm hug.<br><em>“Why?”<br></em>Oh, I see.<br>She doesn’t answer, but I understand.<br>Hearing my voice as I muttered the one-word question, I realised I’m sobbing.<br>She holds me for a while until I get myself back together.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“What happened to you?”<br>“I attacked you in your own home at four in the morning and that’s what you ask?”<br></em>I let out a small giggle as I wiped my tears.<br><em>“You’re in a much worse shape than I am.”<br></em>She drags me to her bed and lays me down.<br>I don’t know why I let her but I followed along.<br>Next thing I know, I’m asleep in her bed.<br>Comfortably unconscious.

                The smell of freshly baked bread woke me up.<br>That was a refreshing night's sleep.<br>But then I remembered what happened yesterday.<br>I rushed down to the kitchen to find… no one?<br>Not just that but, there’s nothing.<br>The smell that woke me up isn’t here, the kitchen is clean and there doesn’t seem to be leftovers from breakfast.<br>Confused, I sat down on the chair processing what happened yesterday.<br>I don’t get it, why would I get a notification for the logic bomb if her computer wasn’t moved.<br>But I don’t actually know, I just assumed she would get hurt.<br>I go back to her room to see that her computer is there and working just fine.<br>I query a report from my program and from what I can see, nothing is unusual, the logic bomb never went off and it never sent an alert.<br>I don’t get it, why?<br>I check my phone’s log only to see that there’s nothing.<br>The front door’s lock clicks, and I hear footsteps walking around.<br>Reaching for my gun, I notice it’s not on my belt but the bedside table on my jacket along with the other various accessories of mine.<br>I pick up the gun and walk downstairs slowly but without aiming it or being overly cautious. It’s definitely Lizzy but I’m still paranoid.<br><em>“Oh snappy, how are we doing this morning?”<br>“You haven’t called me that in years… Had a refreshing sleep but I think my head isn’t quite right yet.”<br>“Go take a shower, breakfast will be ready by then,”</em> she says as she’s laying down the groceries on the table.<br><em>“You got any bread?”<br>“Freshly baked, I was lucky, I got there just as they put it down. It's still warm.”<br>“Alright I’m going to take a shower, I’ll borrow one of Lyre’s tracksuits.”<br>“Help yourself.”</em>

                I go to the large bedroom reserved for the Lux sisters, it’s decorated to their taste and everything.<br>From the wardrobe, I pick a set of clothes and head to the shower.<br>While showering, I try to sort out my thoughts.<br>I don’t exactly understand what’s happening but I’m a lot calmer now. It took me longer than I would like to be honest, I usually hold myself together but this is pushing me to my very limit.<br>After drying myself, I joined Lizzy at the dining table in her living room.<br><em>“Today, we’re having a spoiling breakfast à la Elizabeth. We have four boiled eggs, soup, dates, mini quiches, croissants, and tea,”</em> she says as she’s presenting the items on the table while gesturing ecstatically.<br><em>“You went all out today haven’t you,”</em> I say while unable to hold my smile.<br><em>“Well then, what are you waiting for? Have a seat!”<br></em>Taking my seat, we mostly eat in silence for a while listening to the news.

                <p class="recitation">
                Nothing out of the ordinary happening except for an explosion midtown by the tower.<br>We’re both intrigued by the latter because they don’t give out any details but the fact that no one was injured.<br>As we finish eating she mutes the tv and looks at me with a serious expression.<br><em>“Can you tell me what’s happening now?”<br>“I did a job and now people are out to kill me. I went to the other side of the city and slept in a hotel but I woke up to an alert that said your computer was moved from your house without your consent, thought you were attacked and rushed as fast as I could only to find that you’re fine and that the alert never happened, so I think it was a nightmare.”<br></em>My heart opens up with no restraint. Not only do I know there’s no point lying to her, but it makes me feel endlessly better if I let myself be vulnerable in front of her.<br><em>“Hmm, that explains the supercar outside,”</em> she says along with a giggle.<br><em>“There are bikes with higher speed limits but I thought maybe I’ll need space to put people in.”<br>“I think that came out a bit creepier than you intended.”<br>“Now, I’m a bit worried about your safety, what if they come for you to get to me?”<br></em>The smile on her face disappears as she gets into her serious talk mode.<br><em>“If this is like the incident, I don’t think they would come for me.”<br>“The difference this time is that it’s intentional, it’s not that I’m in the wrong place at the wrong time, my boss just sold me out.”<br>“Then, you can’t run forever, you have to do something about it.”<br>“I don’t plan to lay down and take it, but I don’t have many options.”<br>“How about that contact of yours?”<br></em>I look at her in surprise.<br><em>“You know about that?”<br>“Alright, I may be stupid but I’m not THAT stupid, meeting an acquaintance without ever saying their name and always in weird times and situations and almost always in a location far away? Come on now.”<br>“Fairly certain I never said that collective of things.”<br>“Only once every few months you’d say something out of character, it’s the kind of thing I pick up on.”<br></em>I’m more impressed than anything, and the only reaction I get is a smile.<br><em>“I tried contacting him but for some reason he’s not around, plus I think it’s better not to involve him on this one.”<br>“Then what are you planning on doing?”<br>“Get privilege over them somehow so they don’t kill me?”<br>“And you’re going to do that by sitting in a hotel room?”<br>“I see where you’re coming from.”<br>“I would like to help you but I’m not exactly in shape to do so.”<br>“I didn’t want you finding out in the first place.”<br>“When will you learn to ask for help when you need it? I’ll get Lyre and Sophie on the phone.”<br>“But I don’t wan-”<br></em>Before I could finish my thought she interrupted me.<br><em>“I can take as many days off as needed and they’re in the break period so our full attention will be with you.”<br></em>I didn’t want this to happen, but I can’t help but feel a little happy, it’s like old times.<br>But the fact of the matter is, N is involved somehow, and he specifically told me not to get them involved with him, not in action anyway.<br>As she’s making the call, I get up and hug her from behind and whisper in her ear.<br><em>“Thank you, truly, but I have to do this alone.”<br></em>She must’ve picked up on my determination as she hangs up the phone and turns to me.<br><em>“Don’t get hurt, we’ll be waiting for you.”<br></em>The sad look on her face hurts me but empowers me at the same time.<br>I pick up my backpack and helmet and head out.<br>I stand in front of the car. It feels weird and wrong, but I have a car now.
