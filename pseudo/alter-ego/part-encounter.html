                My first stop… Clarence’s office.<br>My face doesn’t show any sign of seriousness until I enter her office.<br>A look of surprise, nay, almost horror, forms on her face.<br><em>“Why are you back here?!” </em>She asks after getting herself back together.<br>Why is she scared?<br><em>“Well, first I want to quit, and second, I want information.”<br>“What kind of twisted joke is this?”<br>“That’s what I should be asking you, you sold me out so you can get a seat at the big boys’ table, what the hell did you expect was gonna to happen?”<br></em>I find myself screaming at her out of anger I didn’t know I had.<br><em>“We’ve already done this yesterday, what more do you want from me?”<br>“What?”<br>“What do you mean ‘what’?”<br>“What are you on about?”<br>“You broke into my house yesterday and threatened me!”<br></em>I would think she’s just trying to get herself out of this confrontation but she seems to be genuinely scared.<br><em>“I gave you what you wanted, now leave me be!”<br></em>Clarence is the most got together person I know after N, what could she possibly think I did.<br><em>“If you already had me resign in the system that works for me but if you could be a sport and give me whatever information you thought you gave me again that would be grand.”<br></em>I haven’t been this assertive in years, kind of feels good.<br>She starts doing something on the computer and I wait for her to finish, but I do notice the way she’s moving her hands is odd, as in she moves her entire arm not just her hands. Probably a broken wrist from what I can see.<br>After a while, she hands me a USB stick.<br><em>“Now, please leave me be.”<br></em>Although this isn’t what I expected, I take it and leave.

                Back in my car, I think about what just happened, and it just feels weird in too many ways.<br>I drove off to that private cafe with an overview of the commercial district; I realised I don’t even know what it’s called.<br>After taking the elevator up, I sit where we sat last time, and plug in the USB into my laptop.<br>While it’s being scanned, I look around and take in just how well furnished this place is, it gives a feel of a wood cabin in a Norwegian forest.<br>Oh, it seems like the USB is safe, and inside are a few files.<br>From what I could gather, Sed Pharmaceutical Labs is a less-than-legal company that attains cures and treatments to various illnesses that are then sold in the outside world by other companies.<br>I spent a few hours digging around the files, and it turns out that the reason they have a large portfolio is because of the Platinum City only technology that they acquired through some deals with high government officials.<br>But it doesn’t exactly say what that technology is, what it does have though are coordinates to the lab where the experiments are fed back to, and it’s the same as the coordinates that were mentioned in the emails I checked.<br>The thing is, whatever it is they’re doing, it can only happen in this city, that means they’re probably using tech somehow stolen from the GWE.<br>That’s not a spot anyone would want to stand in, which is why they want to keep it so secret, they’d kill anyone that sniffs at it.<br>That should be my first stop although I might want to get something other than a pistol; I’m not planning on injuring anyone badly.<br>Unfortunately, the only place I can think of where I can get a stun gun quickly is that warehouse.<br>Getting any type of weapon is a massive process whether legally or illegally.<br>But, what am I going to do once I get there? Probably try to infiltrate it, I’ll think about what to do once I see it.<br>I’d like to stay for longer but time is of the essence.

                <p class="recitation">
                Leaving the establishment, I head towards the warehouse.<br>Quite unpleasant to come here regularly; not how I imagine my life to turn out.<br>Entering the extravagant mansion warehouse, my path is set straight towards the basement. I'm not planning on spending too much time here.<br>Once again visiting this gallery of thriving life and arsenal of unforgiving death, I look for a stun gun.<br>I found one but it’s not a standard one from what I can tell, luckily it lets me take it out of the case.<br>There are these targets all around the guns’ area, so I test it out.<br>It both looks and behaves like a normal gun except it makes next to no noise, once I check where I hit the target, I don’t see a bullet, just a digital indicator to where it hit.<br>I trust the description on its pedestal enough to assume it’ll work as a stun gun.<br>I leave immediately to my car so I can head to the lab where everything is happening.<br>I could have armed myself better with the many utility items in that basement, but I don’t feel comfortable doing such, not when I don’t know why or how it’s available in the first place.

                On my way through the city, I stopped by a convenience store for some snacks as I think I'm going to spend today just observing.<br>And so, I park in front of an apartment complex. The coordinates took me to what looks like an average block, but it’s expected, not like they’re going to have a neon sign saying illegal experiments happening here.<br>Although you can’t really see who’s in the car, I still tense up when someone walks by while I watch.<br>A few hours have passed and the sun is setting, yet nothing of note happened.<br>I’m running out of snacks and I might have to get some coffee in my system so I can stay on watch during the night as well.<br>So, I drive to the nearest shop and back, but as I get back, a black truck parks in front of the building, it opens, and six armed men get out of it straight into the building.<br>They seemed to be in a rush, I sat and waited in anticipation, but nothing happened for an entire hour.<br>My rush dissipates and I’m left wondering what that was about, the truck is still outside but they never left.<br>But then something happens, not what I expected to see, not something I can make sense of.<br>A child emerges casually from beyond the complex’s doors, and behind him follows 4 trolleys that dumb the bodies on them inside the van.<br>I look around the street to notice that it’s empty, unnaturally so. There’s no one around to witness this once in a lifetime scene.<br>I keep watching as he goes back into the building and comes out with more bodies, a lot more than six.<br>The six men that went inside looked the same, uninjured, possibly just knocked out, but then the other ones had blood all over them, with the lack of light and my distance, that’s all I could make out.<br>I use my phone’s camera to zoom in to see the inside of the back of the truck to see that some of the bodies are missing entire limbs.<br>What the hell is going on?
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Just as I thought it couldn’t get weirder, it did. He drags out what seems to be a deformed naked body.<br>I don’t even know how I'm supposed to react to that one.<br>After closing the back of the truck, he proceeds to do something on the driver’s seat and step back from the truck.<br>Then the truck drives off on its own.<br>I can’t help but look at this scene with a look not of horror or surprise, but just plain bewilderment.<br>The kid turns and makes eye contact with me. I don’t know how he can see me through one way glass, or why I feel that we’re making eye contact from this long-distance, but I know he is.<br>His head tilts a little and the smile he had on all this time widens as he closes his eyes like a parakeet.<br>And then, he simply walks away.<br>I don’t know how to react to this, so many wrong things happened in so little time that I honestly don't know how to react anymore.<br>Still, this is an opportunity to check out what’s going on.

                <p class="recitation">
                I walked up to the front door to find that it was left open.<br>I let myself into a large white reception, with large blood spatters here and there, chairs spread out and fallen over, everything’s a mess, like a tornado passed by here.<br>Looking at the desk, there’s large claw marks over it. The computer interface is crushed. And what I think was a chair is but scraps spread over the floor.<br><em>“Ah yes, of course, not an indoor tornado, obviously what happened here is a bear on steroids broke in to rob the place.”<br></em>This entire scenario is a joke. This only happens in movies. There aren’t labs that get attacked by inhuman things because of experiments gone wrong.<br>It's a bad plot really, cliché and overused.<br>I walk through the dim-lit corridor trying to open doors with caution, there are marks of things I don’t recognise all over the walls.<br>Not human-made that’s for sure, like a setup to a horror movie.<br>What’s unnerving about it is less the creepy remnants of a fight, but the fact there’s no trace of any of it outside the facility.<br>Someone made sure it didn’t leave this place, and if they can do that, then why not stop it altogether.<br>Seeing all the blood marks gives me a pit in my stomach.

                One of the doors felt like I could push open, and I did.<br>That was extremely convenient.<br>I walked into a monitoring station.<br>Maybe I can use this to unravel what happened here.<br>Most cameras seem to be off but I can rewind to old footage.<br>I start by checking the layout of the lab and from what I can figure out, there are various experiment rooms with a lot of pods that were all getting various chemicals pumped into them, but a specific chemical that was pumped into all of them came from a specific room.<br>Oh, I forgot to mention, the experiments happening here are trying to achieve full-body cloning.<br>I say ‘trying to achieve it’ but it says over various reports that they were able to make a few adult human bodies but they would die in less than an hour.<br>For some reason the only reaction this information gets out of me is impression; it’s not something I would expect to happen any time soon even with the available advancements of The Wyrm.<br>Now if I were to guess where it all started, I’d say from the room that’s pumping all the pods with chemicals.<br>I rewind the feed of said room 24h back.<br>I tense up as fear starts building up.<br>Seeing the after effects only disgusted me but this invokes true fear.<br>Locked in the centre of the room is a monster that’s, funnily enough, as big as a bear standing on its hind legs, maybe even bigger.<br>I’ve never seen anything so… so.<br>Standing on six massive legs like that of a crab, and has another six arms stuck to the holed crust armour, weird goo leaking from the various cracks on its shell, and tubes stuck to it all over its body while being held down by numerous chains piercing its 12 claws and the base of its body from one side to another.<br>I’m both disgusted by the creature itself and how it’s being treated.<br>If it didn’t make occasional erratic movements I wouldn’t even register it as a living thing, it looks like a horrible sculpture made out of crustaceans with the general form of a spike.<br>It doesn’t even have a face or head that I can identify.

                <p class="recitation">
                I gather my resolve and start skipping forward through the footage.<br>At some point yesterday a guy in a full hazmat suit walked, threw a canister under the creature, and left as quickly as he could.<br>So even the workers are scared shitless of that thing, like looking at it alone invokes fear.<br>The creature manages to crouch down even though it’s more restrained than a secured nuclear warhead and stands back up again with the canister gone.<br>I guess it has a mouth under that? What kind of creature is this and where did they even find it? How and why? All these questions I won’t worry about until after I get the chance to think.<br>Moving forward in the footage, about 9 hours ago, just two hours before I got here, someone else walked into the room, not wearing any protective gear.<br>They walked up to one of the large creature’s leg to be the same height as a claw.<br>Maybe my comparison to a simple bear was a little bit inaccurate.<br>They stroke the claw like one would stroke an injured elephant out of pity.<br>They turn and look straight at the camera with an angry expression.<br>My heart skips a bit.<br>What was once fear turns into horror.<br>The alarm goes off and she runs to an interface by the door shutting herself in.<br>She then walks up to the interface in the middle of the room in front of the creature and starts messing with it.<br>Slowly, one by one, the tubes start to disconnect from the creature, falling to the ground and spilling their content. From the holes left behind, a green fluid, much like the one that was leaking from the cracks but less coagulated, spews out.<br>She stands there unphased by the puddle of god knows what that’s covering the floor and the massive tubes falling as if she knows they won’t hit her, or maybe she just doesn’t care if they do.<br>After all the tubes are on the ground, the holes start closing and the shell is complete.<br>The creatures jumped with massive power, breaking the chains holding it as if they weren’t the main thing keeping it in check.<br>Its legs hold on to the wall above the doorway like a spider.

                She walks up to the interface by the door and the loud alarms stop, and the room falls to silence, even the banging of people from the outside stopped a while back, there is nothing.<br>She looked at the camera with sadness and pointed to the interface.<br>The footage ends.<br>I quickly switch to the camera attached to that interface and go back to seconds before the other camera turns off.<br>She looks at me and starts talking.<br><em>“You don’t have to worry about this you know, I’ll deal with it, I told N not to get me involved yet here I am, probably watching this horror unfold, go back to Lizzy’s place and have nice seafood pizza, forget this ever happened, move on.”<br></em>Looking at her this close and hearing her voice.<br>Looking at myself this close and hearing my voice.<br>That’s definitely me.<br>The footage ends, but I can guess what happened next.

                There’s too much to unpack right now.<br>Slowly, I walk out of the facility.<br>The world is doing that thing again where it goes out of focus again.<br>Where did I park my bike? I don’t see it anywhere.<br>I should call it to me, but where’s my phone?<br>I must’ve left it in the car.<br>I take out my phone from the car and stand by the road waiting for my bike to arrive.<br>Maybe the system is bugged because it says it’s next to me.

                I’m tired of waiting, I’ll just take this car instead.<br>After all, I did exchange my bike for it so I get to use it.<br>I drive to Lizzy’s.<br>It’s about dinner time so she’s probably awake.<br>I’ll borrow a room for the night.<br>You know what I didn’t do? I haven’t been back to my actual home in a while.<br>I’ll check on it some other time.<br>Right now, what I want is a chill evening with the girls; if I’m lucky they’ll be staying over as well.<br>Oh, I don’t have a bike anymore, that explains why it was pinging the car next to me. It’s because it’s my car.<br>Pulling up in the driveway, I can see the Lux sisters’ car is also parked.<br>My lucky day.
