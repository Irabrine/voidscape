                Elizabeth leaves her white car in the parking lot at the supermarket and goes in to do the shopping for the week, it is Sunday after all.<br>The moment she’s no longer to be seen, a black van pulls up next to her car, inside are three buff men, the driver is holding binoculars looking at the entrance of the supermarket.<br><em>“Alright boys, same as usual, pull her in before she unlocks her car.”<br>“I feel like we should be careful, this one is unusually expensive, even for the rates of this city.”<br>“Yeah, I’m with Ray on this one, let’s be as quick as possible.”</em>
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Ten minutes pass with the three men patiently waiting for Elizabeth to come back when suddenly they hear a knock on the van door.<br>One of the two in the back opens the door and sees a little boy in front of them wearing a backpack.<br><em>“Excuse me, have you seen my mum, she told me she was going to pick me up but the car is empty.”<br>“Oh, she just went shopping while waiting for you, come in, stay with us while we wait for your mum, we’re her friends.”<br>“Oh, okay thanks.”<br></em>The kid walks into the van and sits down.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                The driver flips over a file he has on his hand while the kid fiddles with his backpack and the other 2 men talk softly to the kid.<br><em>“So, how old are ye, wee lad?”<br>“I’m nine years and four months old.”<br>“And did you come from a school? I didn’t know one was around here.”<br>“No, I just had an assignment.”<br></em>The driver turns back with a confused look on his face.<br><em>“I didn’t know Lizzy had a kid, what’s your name, little one.”<br>“My name’s Zero, and you didn’t know she had a kid because she doesn’t have one.”<br></em>The men’s facial expression changes and before they could react, the kid, with inhuman speed, pulls out a gun from his backpack and shoots three times, a light coming out of the gun hits each of the men’s subclavian veins.<br>One of them lunges at the kid but falls unconscious nearly immediately on him, and the other two also fail at reacting as they’re all now knocked out.<br>The kid tapes the driver’s hand to the wheel and straps his neck to the head cushion so he doesn’t fall off; he pulls out a thick metallic disk with a red button in the middle and six claws coming out of it, and he puts it around the wheel.<br>Four claws hold the disk in place and after the kid pressed the red button, the other two claws dug into the car to access more control.<br>He pulls out a phone and tinkers with it a little, afterwards, he leaves the van putting his phone away.<br>The van drives off as the kid skips away into the supermarket.<br>Half an hour later, Elizabeth leaves the supermarket with a full trailer towards her car, she unpacks everything in the trunk and puts back the trailer to where it’s supposed to be.<br>She drives away unaware of anything.
