                I take my time on the road.<br>It should only take me twenty minutes to get there but I need time to think and calm down. Looking suspicious is the last thing I need right now. So I take a path through the Biome Domes by the outskirts of the economic district to relax a little looking at plants and wildlife; it’s very nice that there’s a public section that works like a closed safari.<br>I wouldn’t have been stressing this much if N didn’t constantly warn me about the underworld every time we meet. He scares every cell in my body, but he doesn’t get serious with me except when it comes to when I step too close to something I shouldn’t know.<br>Clarence knows there was already an attempt on my life that’s why she put me on this job. I'm the only one that interacted with the underworld before but that’s not a good thing so her decision confuses me. Guess I’ll find out with time.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I can feel my heartbeat returning to normal, perfect timing as I’m a few minutes off my destination.<br>Not what I expected, this place looks like a massive apartment complex for the rich. I would never suspect this place to be a lab if I didn’t know about it.<br>I ring the doorbell and wait patiently.<br>After a while, the door opens slightly and behind it is a young man with an unwelcoming look on him.<br>I look at him with the most blank expression I can pull off and hand him my card.<br><em>“If you would follow me to your office and please don’t stray off, you don’t have permission to be anywhere but the reception, the corridor, and your temporary office,” </em>He responds in the blandest of voices that goes well with his demeanour.<br><em>“Roger.”</em>
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Following him, in contrast to the outside, I got the feeling of a professional lab the moment I stepped in, everything is white and squeaky clean, I could see my reflection just by looking at the wall.<br>He takes me through a long corridor with many doors along the way to an office, it looks like a stylish home office just without the windows.<br><em>“You have that cable over there that's connected to the main server controller, I’m told you’re not going to need anything else?”<br>“Well yes, but I might need the toilet at some point.”<br>“That would be the door in front of your door”<br>“Alright thanks, you can leave now, I’ll get started immediately.”<br></em>I take a seat at the desk, putting my laptop on it, and it seems he was waiting for me to do so since he left only after I finished setting myself up.<br><em>“This ought to be a joyous experience.”</em>
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I go on with my day as if this is nothing but another day of work; I set up my programs and algorithms, the basic first day of work.<br>I gather my things at five and head out, following back the corridor I was brought in through.<br>The young man walks me to the door on my way out.<br>I get on my motorcycle and launch at full speed.<br>I’m heading towards an unused industrial district. It was evacuated because of some event before I was even born. I don’t get why they never reopened it, such a large space wasted in the middle of the city, I guess they don’t need any more space to consider it.<br>The ride there is an hour away from work, but it’s not like I have any better ideas.<br>I enter the large field that’s filled with shipping containers piled over each other and stacked railways.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Man, it feels really weird being familiar with this place, an abandoned storage facility isn’t something people get used to, but I somehow managed to come here enough times to know my way around it.<br>I park in a clearing and stand by my bike. A few moments later, from one of the crates, a silhouette walks out slowly and stands a few metres in front of me.<br>There stands the figure of a strong young man, with a feminine face and delicate features, the combination of the young face with the mature body always throws me off balance. He stands there leaning on a cane wearing a tuxedo and a top hat.<br><em>“Seriously? A tux?”<br>“You haven’t visited in months, the least I could do is look proper, wouldn’t you agree?”<br></em>The man speaks in a pompous accent with an easy-to-the-ear soft voice and a smile on his face.<br><em>“Drop the accent N, I’m not in the mood.”<br>“Myes, that’s always the case with you isn’t it, so to what do I owe the pleasure?”<br>“I’m doing a job involving people out of the public codex.”<br>“Oh, it’s finally happening isn’t it.”<br></em>The man’s accent changes back to normal.<br><em>“I told you to be careful haven’t I, your mistake was in telling that boss of yours about our encounter.”<br>“And why is that?”<br>“She’s a snake that’ll only look out for herself, and you gave her a doorway to everything she wishes for.”<br>“Dude, how do you even know her?”<br>“So what is it you want me to get you? You wouldn’t be here if you’re not planning on buying something”<br></em>He’s changing the subject on purpose, but I won’t get anything out of him so I won’t push it further.<br>“Plastic BackDoor”<br>He raises an eyebrow in response to my request and his smile turns into a grin.<br><em>“Smart move, but you’ll have to be quick, you have a limited amount of time.”<br></em>He pulls out a small transparent plastic bag with a tiny black mould and a small USB drive inside from his pocket.<br><em>“This is why I avoid coming to you man.”<br></em>It’s really creepy how he always has what I need ready before I get here.<em><br>“That’ll be 800,000 vals.”<br>“Is this my best option?”<br></em>I couldn’t hide the desperation in my voice, and I think he heard it because the smile disappeared as he answered me with a mere nod. And with that, I pull out my credit card and throw it at him. He catches it midair and puts it in his pocket. He then pulls it out and throws it back alongside the bag he was holding at me.<br><em>“That was almost all of my savings, this better do what I think it does.”<br>“It’s time to put all that training to the test dear Aurae.”<br></em>He says, walking away and disappearing between containers.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I put the bag into my backpack and drive home. Anxiety is overwhelming me but I control it before it gets out of hand. I’ll get through this as long as I keep my calm.<br>I get home more drained than usual. I change quickly into my pyjamas and slump on my bed and straight to the dream world, I go.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Morning comes and my stomach is angry at me for not having dinner yesterday. With whatever energy I have left, I do my routine of callisthenics and shower, then for breakfast, I decided to treat myself today, so I’m going to fry three eggs with beef jerky and bologna.<br>After breakfast, I head to the laboratory where I’ll be working for a while.<br>Same thing as yesterday happened, I was escorted to the office where I’ll be spending the day.<br>I let an hour pass before I pulled out the mould from my backpack. I use a small plastic knife to cut a part of the network cable delicately without damaging the wire.<br>I take the small mould and cover the wire with it. Once it’s all covered, I wait for a minute, letting it settle, and the black colour of the mould starts to change into the greyish white colour of the network cable. It looks like the original wasn’t even altered.<br>“How does…. What???”<br>Unable to hide my bewilderment I start touching the cable trying to feel for cuts or see if it’ll change to my skin colour but it’s just an ordinary cable.<br>No wonder this thing costs more than a kidney, but does it work? I don’t get how it would and it’s not like I can just ask people, according to N, only a handful of people even know it exists.<br>As much as I’m afraid of N, he never lied and I trust him enough to test if this thing really works.<br>I continue my day working as usual after I clean up after myself, but with extra energy spikes every now and then from my excitement to go home and test out what could be an ordeal to change my understanding of physics and technology.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Five comes and I leave heading for home. On my way home I stop by a restaurant for some take out dinner.<br>The first thing I do after changing is plugging the USB that N gave me into my computer.<br>Excited to see if it works, my jaw opens and my brain is fried.<br>I can access the lab’s files like I’m opening the contents of my USB. I look around the files to see that they indeed are the labs as they match what I could access when I was at work except even faster.<br><em>“I don’t get it, this shouldn’t work, I don’t even notice input lag!”<br></em>I don’t notice myself voicing my mind.<br><em>“The network is closed from the outside, so how is it broadcasting?”<br></em>I lean back in my chair and stare at my screens for a while just letting it sink in.<br>Alright, it takes me a minute but I calm my thoughts and start focusing on the task at hand.<br>Most of my time is spent looking for exploits to elevate my privilege so I don’t have time to look for extra information. I think the first thing I should look for is any mention of this employment or my name in their databases.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I set it up so my computer here at home is always parsing through files constantly through a rootkit while I give it deeper access the higher my privileges go. I also turn on my computer’s logic bomb if someone but myself tries to access it. I never thought that someday I’d get paranoid enough to use it. I spend a few hours looking for exploits as if I’m still in the office before getting tired.<br>I start having dinner while watching an anime. Before going to sleep, I set up a brute force program to run in the background using the computer’s spare resources.<br>It takes me a while to fall asleep as my mind is bustling with thoughts and ideas, and I can feel my heart race; it’s a great sensation I don’t often feel.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                The next day, I got to the lab and worked as I normally would. When I’m back home, I add a few hours of work there before watching an episode or two of my show before sleeping. I usually like chilling at home after working but this will require me to put in the extra effort.<br>This stays the same for a week and a half. I got invited to hang out with Elizabeth and the Lux sisters, they were going for an airsoft match, but I declined and stayed home and kept working over the weekend.<br>My running inquiry for my name or anything related to the job was pinging me with findings but I let them stack until I get enough privilege to have access to all files so whenever I read it, it will be when I have all the information available.

                Wednesday night comes, I get home with coffee ready to finally uncover the nature of this job. I’m not a coffee person but I’ve been running out of energy lately, as I’ve been working on this for more than a week nonstop, overwork is catching up to me.<br>This assignment is mentioned in various conversations between lab members but nothing too out of the ordinary, just informing them that there’s a security test and that an outsider is going to be in office, which explains how I have been avoided almost entirely.<br>But something strikes me as odd, this is the first security check. I just assumed that the physical check was done before but nothing about it shows up. Did they skip it? Why would they do that though? It comes with the basic package and I’ve never seen someone decline it before, sure sometimes we get requests to not have the cyber team to interact with the human engineering team but this just strikes me as odd.

                <p class="recitation">
                I finally get to the messages that have my name. Encrypted emails I had to get kernel access to read, this ought to be good.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>What the hell?<br>Somehow what I found is worse than all my expectations.<br>The assignment didn’t go through proper channels but straight to my boss. The deal was to provide a skilled hacker that is to be terminated after the assignment in exchange for access to the underworld network.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Excuse me what? When they say ‘terminated’… they’re going to try and kill me after this.<br>Why would Clarence send me, of all people, one of her most valuable assets?<br>Oh, of course, if she suddenly becomes connected to the underworld, little old me would notice and she doesn’t want that.<br>I was sold out by my boss.<br>The years of work that I put in and all that effort, and this is my reward.<br>I trusted her, told her about the attempt on my life, how my life was saved, and how the murders went uninvestigated and buried.<br>I shouldn’t have done that, I should’ve listened to him, I should’ve forgotten about it and moved on, but how could I? They tried to kill me, and the moment he came, two lives were snuffed out in an instant. That’s not something you can forget, that’s not something you don’t talk about and bottle up with time, that’s something you have to tell. And now, it’s going to happen again. This time he won’t be there for me, this time I might die, this time I’m all alone with no one to trust.<br>This time, I have to stand up for myself.<br>This time, I have to fight back.<br>This time, I’m capable of fighting back.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Well then, let’s see what is so secret that they’d kill anyone that gets a glimpse of it.<br>I do an inquiry of the most used phrases and ignoring the common ones, ‘Green Fig’ comes up a lot between high-level personnel.<br>A few hours of digging into files but I don’t get much info out of it, all the talk around it seem to be heavily coded, excessively so considering that no one is supposed to have access to the files or emails in the first place; but the one thing I got is coordinates to some central lab where major experiments all feed back to, one separate to where I go to, in fact, it’s not even in the same district.<br>They seem to expect specific shipments regularly of smuggled goods while also exporting some sort of raw material.<br>Is this it? I’m going to get killed for half-baked information that can’t possibly mean anything?<br>Well, might as well try to figure out what it is they actually do. I’m not going down without a fight.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                Now I have to think about the little problem that is when I’m supposed to be terminated, it says when I report the final exploit I could find. I should’ve read that before work, I already reported that I have kernel access meaning my job is done with the diagnoses and proposed fixes reported to HQ.<br>Meaning, my execution can happen at any moment now.<br>I modify the logic bomb on my computer so that if it’s activated, it deletes any mention of my name or anything related to me from the Lab’s database, with the ‘Plastic Backdoor’ and the rootkit, they can’t kick me out of their systems, the least I can do is delete my presence.<br>I’m going to have to leave home for a while, so I get off my chair and start packing a few things into my large backpack. I put my laptop in there, along with a few sets of clothes and a few towels.<br>I’ll need to rest but I’m not sure if I can fall asleep with my racing heart and overclocked brain, so I eat one of my instant sleep pills that knocks me out cold until I’m fully rested.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                I dream of a large and closed cylinder room, mossy stone bricks for walls and no windows or doors. There I stood in the middle, racing heart and twitching limbs. I don’t like this.<br>Looking up, the roof is nowhere to be seen, the room expands vertically with no end.<br>I start feeling around the stone wall hoping to find an opening of loose bricks but no luck. As I’m investigating the wall, I hear a meow behind me. Turning, I see a small grey kitten in the middle of the room, huddled for warmth as it shivers.<br>I pick it up and go sit by the wall. I put it up against my chest and hold it like I’m holding a small baby giving it warmth. After a while it stopped shivering, and so did I. Having this small creature between my arms calmed me down.<br>It opens its eyes slowly and jumps off my hand, it starts running towards the opposite side of the room, but with each step, it grows bigger and bigger and it ignites into flame hitting the wall.<br>A hole big enough for a human to pass through is made in the wall, and the cat is nowhere to be seen.<br>This does not surprise me, if anything, it doesn’t make me react in any way. I walk through the hole to the other side.<br>I’m on the edge of an ever-green cliff looking at the vast and beautiful ocean. I turn back to where I was trapped only to find that it’s a giant well.
