                On the rooftop of one large elegant restaurant, sits a strong young man, with a feminine face and delicate features and long combed hair wearing a tracksuit, and a young purple-haired woman, wearing a red dress, sitting by the edge looking out from their table at a garden nearby.<br>The woman elegantly puts the fork with the cut piece of steak into her mouth.<br><em>“You sure she’ll get through this Nero?”<br></em>She speaks with a light-to-the-ear voice.<br><em>“She’ll do just fine, the question is if she would accept us afterwards or not.”<br></em>The man speaks nonchalantly as he’s eating from his bowl of lentils.<br><em>“I still think the operation choice was hastily made, we could’ve smoothed it over some more.”<br>“I have complete faith in her, plus, if things go south it just means she wasn’t good enough.”<br>“But a good person will die, possibly more if she’s not careful.”<br></em>The man shrugs without answering.

                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“So, her group managed to get into an Observer Outpost’s possible attenders.”<br></em>The pity in her voice disappeared completely along with the previous topic.<br><em>“Honestly, I didn’t expect that.”<br></em>He voices his surprise with the lowest degree of enthusiasm but just enough for it to count as a surprise.<br><em>“Was it Sara that influenced it?”<br></em>The genuine interest put in that question can be heard.<br><em>“As far as I can tell, that wasn’t her doing, the entire collective somehow reached a state of individuality and got its own factors.”<br>“Should we be worried? If she’s a part of the collective that’ll affect her luck.”<br>“Sadly not, she cursed with invariable luck.”<br></em>A sad expression forms on the woman’s face while the man’s doesn’t change during the whole conversation.<br><em>“She could’ve had a normal life.”<br>“Sometimes the world has its own plans for you.”<br></em>Silence is shared between the two as they finish their meals.

                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“Well, I’m off to the casino, drop by later if you like.”<br></em>The woman says this as she stands on the ledge of the building.<br><em>“Don’t stay out too late, it’s movie night.”<br></em>The man answers with a sad smile on his face.<br><em>“I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”<br></em>The woman says so with a big smile on her face, she then takes a step forward disappearing as she falls vertically.<br>Nobody else eating on the top floor seems to have noticed the woman who jumped off.<br>The man heaves a miserable sigh and traces a yellow-striped motorcycle that drives off in the distance with his ever tired eyes.<br>After finishing his drink, the man slowly walks downstairs where he pays the waiter and leaves the restaurant.

                As he walks through the street, he gets a phone call. He listens, and the bored expression on his face changes into surprise, nay, horror.<br>“I’m sorry, WHAT?!”<br>He stops in his tracks for a good minute before hanging up the phone and quickly calls someone else on his contacts.<br>The other side picks up almost instantly.<br>“Yes?”<br>The voice from the other side is the same as the woman he was having dinner with.<br>“We have an emergency, I’m going to drop off Sara’s package, meet me at the warehouse in 13.”<br>The man’s face changes to a slight smirk of excitement.<br>“I haven’t heard you this excited in years.”<br>“The cat’s back!”
