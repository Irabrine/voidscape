                A large man who looks in his late fifties walks on the gravel floor against the flow of the river.<br>His granddaughter told him someone asked for him specifically when she was out foraging for fresh tistis mushrooms.<br>This happens every few years, but never out of town; nevertheless, he’s always welcoming to challengers.<br><em>“You’ve aged, </em>A’krozni<em>…”<br></em>He hears a very familiar voice behind him.<br>Turning around to confirm his surprise, he’s welcomed by a smiling face he thought he’ll never see again.<br>There stands a tall and athletic woman with a beautiful young face. At a whopping 273cm, 30cm above the tallest of men, she can’t help but look down at the old friend.<br>A large black cloak covers most of her right side, with her left side revealing a beautiful top of silk full of yellow and red patterns and comfortable blue pants.<br>Not the most fashionable of looks, but she was never one to know what looks good.<br><em>“You haven’t aged a day…”<br></em>That means the rumours were indeed true.<br>His heart is in conflict with itself, not sure how to feel about her sudden visit.<br>He thought surely she must’ve forgotten about him; her life, afterall, is full of people that come and go.<br>And yet, here she stands before him, Vezirva.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“I don’t even get a hug?”<br></em>With shock still in his face, he approaches her slowly with open arms.<br>She wraps her left arm around him until he recovers.<br><em>“It’s good to see you boss…”<br></em>His composure returned not much after and a comfortable smile formed.<br><em>“I see you’ve settled down.”</em><br>They’re walking towards the very small town as they’re chatting.<br>His posture is much more relaxed on the way back as he doesn’t have to be on the defensive anymore.<br><em>“It’s not impressive compared to most places… but it’s a place I can call home.”<br></em>It’s very true.<br>The entire town is composed of less than 60 buildings.<br>Less than half of them are reserved for actually living while the rest are occupied by various purposes, from storage to workshops. It’s mostly storage though.<br><em>“I rather disagree, this place is much more impressive than you think.”<br>“Oh yeah?”<br>“Just 1 generation before your time, this place wasn’t inhabited at all… there was nothing as far as the eye can see.”<br>“Oh? You’ve been here before?”</em><br><em>“This used to be a popular merchant road, if you’re ever going towards The Nail from the east, you’d probably pass through here.”<br>“People still do that, it’s our main source of everything really.”<br>“The view here was great enough that some nomads decided they’ll settle here… it’s funny how it used to be just a camp of 12 or so tents and mad enough people to try and live off nothing.”<br></em>There’s nothing much here in terms of resources.<br>Sure there’s a river for water but that’s about it.<br>The closest forest is about 6km away and practically no stone hills.<br>Food is viable for any half decent hunter and forager but to populate a town, it’s asking too much.<br>They still managed to build a sizable town, mostly out of pine logs but that didn’t stop them from getting creative with it.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                The buildings in this town expand horizontally, with most only having but a ground floor. It’s compensated by having a much larger area.<br>You can tell which buildings are houses as they each have their own stone decorations built in the foundation to contrast the fully wooden stores and facilities.<br>Vezirva has to lower her head before heading into his house.<br>They walk past a large courtyard with a skylight above a fountain with seats around it. From there, there’s many entrances to various parts of the house.<br>It’s not uncommon for entire families to live in large houses like these in small communities.<br>They are no exception, as Vezirva’s immediately welcomed by a young maiden the moment they sit down in the beautiful garden.<br><em>“Luminations, dearest guest.”<br></em>Vezirva answers her bow with a nod and a smile.<br>The girl quickly rushes over somewhere soon after her welcoming.<br><em>“I hope the place is to your liking.”<br>“Very homely… must be very active during the evenings.”<br>“Haha… yeah, the kids like to have their fun.”<br></em>There’s various toys spread everywhere.<br><em>“Did you ever end up having a family?”<br>“I can’t say I tried, no… I’m not the type to settle down in one place for longer than a few years.”<br></em>Before that could go any further, the girl from earlier came back with a tray of treats to put on their empty table.<br>A teapot and a couple of plates with different kinds of biscuits.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“This is my granddaughter, Ashna.”<br></em>Ashna smiles and nods her head while a slightly confused look forms on Vezirva’s face.<br><em>“Wait, <strong>grand...</strong>daughter?”<br></em>Ashna looks at her with a puzzled look of her own while A’krozni has a hearty laugh.<br><em>“And this is Vezirva, a Golden Raven.”<br>“Oh my, you’re one of gramps’ old teammates?” </em>she asks with excitement.<br><em>“Something like that yeah…”<br>“Well, she wasn’t my teammate… she was the boss.”<br></em>Ashna’s eyes widen even larger than before.<br><em>“OH! You’re <strong>THE </strong>boss? Wrath’s Blade?”<br></em>Vezirva couldn’t help but laugh at that. It’s very entertaining to her that she didn’t recognise her name at all but knew her nickname.<br><em>“I heard a lot about you… I’m sure gramps exaggerated a bit but if half of it is true then you’ve led an amazing life.”<br>“Oh, adventuring is overrated most of the time. An ordinary life can be equally amazing if not more.”<br></em>She doesn’t mean it.<br><em>“You could share some of your stories over tea.” </em>A’krozni’s also interested in what she’s been up to over the many years he hadn’t heard from her.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                <em>“Well, I had a couple of decades rest after escaping from the Sand Flakes so the closest story to after we last saw each other must be our hunt for the Demarian Larva.”<br>“What are the Sand Flakes?” </em>the girl asks.<br>A’krozni is more surprised by how casually she mentions escaping it.<br><em>“It’s a desert of white sand… known to be the deadliest location to exist…” </em>he explains to his daughter.<br><em>“I picked up the team from their long vacation and immediately headed south. A Demarian egg hatching was quick news to get around, so we luckily had a couple of weeks to work with.”<br></em>She obviously wanted to skip over the impossible bit of the story.
                </p>
                <p class="recitation">
                She shared some of her stories as they had tea.<br>The girl was very excited throughout the sitting, constantly jumping between disbelief and amusement, while her granddad was happy to hear that his old teammates are doing well.<br>But then he remembered something that made everything past that point very weird.<br><em>“Wait… I just remembered that when I last saw you… your arm...”<br></em>He just now realised she’s been eating with her left.<br>How has he not taken notice of her cloaked right side?<br>It’s like it was always just out of his attention.<br><em>“Haha, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice.”<br></em>Ashna looks confused at their exchange, as nothing is out of the ordinary about Vezirva’s arm.<br>It’s only now that he notices bright blue symbols marked all over her cloak; A distortion rune, a ripple rune, and some connecting runes he’s never seen before setup in a matrix.<br>She slowly removes the cloak to reveal a grey arm below it.<br>The arm is beautifully sculpted in some sort of grey wood. The arm is a perfect mirror of her left arm in a relaxed position, but somehow, its form has a weird beauty to it. Perhaps it’s the sheen and wooden texture.<br>Though the shape of her arm is the same, there’s deep engravings throughout the wood; identical carvings in the shape of an eye spread throughout her non-arm without a clear pattern.<br><em>“It’s Tanaran Steel, Carved by yours truly…”<br></em>Vezirva strokes her arm and the eye markings glow a little.<br>Her shirt covers the connecting point in her shoulder, and it’s probably for the best.<br><em>“Wow…”<br></em>Ashna can only utter words of astonishment.<br><em>“You’ve gone without a right arm this whole time?” </em>His question has a hint of pity.<br><em>“Oh, it’s alright… it was fun learning to swing a sword with my left.”<br>“Ha! You still refuse to get with the times huh.”<br>“I am the times! Rune carvers just aren’t as efficient as my swordsmanship yet.”<br></em>They share a laugh between each other while Ashna’s still admiring the carved wooden arm.<br>Swordsmanship is now a thing of the past. Mainly taught as a novelty, and in other situations, as a hand to hand combat emergency situation.<br>Vezirva on the other hand, still uses the blade in any type of combat that requires a weapon.<br>She’s a well established rune smith and very skilled at carving; so much so, that she taught A’krozni the foundation and some very advanced techniques for carving.<br>Her choice to stick to a form of primitive weaponry and both admirable and questionable.<br>That is the case until you see her in combat. She can indeed pull off more with a sword than 63 men can with rune carvers. Maybe she can do more with a rune carver of her own? Nobody quite knows since she never showed interest.

                <p class="recitation">
                Vezirva and A’krozni walk through the large open streets of dirt under the unpleasantly hot sun.<br><em>“You did a rather splendid job at setting up the running water channels.”<br>“We may be a small village, but it doesn’t excuse having to go outside to a spring for simple needs.”<br>“Very fine craftsmanship throughout.”<br></em>There’s a small silence afterwards.<br>A’krozni remembers well how socially awkward she can be. If anything, it’s impressive she lasted this long as the one taking the initiative for small talk.<br><em>“If I may ask…”<br>“Mhm?”<br>“Why is it you decided to visit after a lifetime?”<br></em>He was bound to ask at some point.<br><em>“Oh yeah…” </em>Rather than finding it an awkward thing to bring up, she just forgot.<br><em>“I came to warn you that you’ll have an extended lifespan.”<br>…<br>…<br></em>A’krozni bursts into a hearty laugh, stopping in his tracks.<br>She looks at him with a hint of confusion.<br><em>“Oh… so sorry… it’s just…” </em>he laughs some more. <em>“Yeah.. thanks… I noticed when I outlived my wife by a couple of centuries.”<br>“Oh, you knew?”<br></em>How could he not know? He still ages but at a very decelerated rate.<br><em>“Yeah… I figured it out a while back.”<br>“Oh… well… I’m glad you’re taking it so well.”<br>“Did you just realise this?”<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><br></span></em>He continues his walking.<br><em>“It’s impressively difficult to find out information about True Artefacts… that and I had to make sure there’s capable Golden Ravens before I left on my own personal quest.”<br></em>So… she stopped training newer generations…<br><em>“What’s a True Artefact?”<br>“Not quite sure…”<br></em>He can only respond with a confused face that spells: ‘seriously?’<br>She doesn’t need to look at him to know that he’s asking why she brought it up then.<br><em>“From what I gathered, it’s a very specific type of powerful object… but that’s all I got.”<br>“It feels like you told me nothing there…”<br>“Well, the Serverous Pulse was such an item… they’re usually sought over by powerful beings, and we just happened to be misfortunate enough to look for one that was wanted by a dragon.”<br></em>Is she gonna keep name dropping things that don’t make sense and need explanation?<br><em>“A dragon?”<br></em>He’s still curious about it so he doesn’t mind being inquisitive.<br><em>“All I can tell you is that the creatures from myth and old aren’t the only things considered dragons.”<br></em>She actually has no idea about that one.

                They stand before a large building with a higher ceiling than most.<br><em>“Here we are.”<br></em>To her request, he took her to one of the farm houses.<br>They enter through the large double doors to a huge open room with pots of all sizes arranged to fill the room; there’s even rows with pots floating above another set, some stack twice while others thrice, depending on what they’re growing and how much headspace they need.<br>Various light runes are carved into the ceiling of both the building and the floating pots, providing luminescence to the sun-craving plants.<br>Water flows along the ground and upstream, almost in a self regulating manner.<br>They did well to hide the forcefield runes that keep the water in check. She guessed that it was A’krozni’s touch.<br>Vezirva pulls out a slip of paper with marks written on it and slides it under her coat for it to touch one of the eyes on her carved arm.<br>A pinkish beautiful wave of energy bursts out, slightly distorting the air around her for a second before settling back to normal.<br>The yellowish light runes change hue to match the pinkish wave that passed through them.<br>The runes themselves grow extensions that don’t quite seem like helper runes, or like runes at all; as if they were misspelt.<br><em>“What did you do?”<br></em>A’krozni’s not at all worried about her casually messing with one of the village’s sources of food.<br><em>“Slight enhancement I wanted to try out…<br>“In theory, this should accelerate growth and help the local micro ecosystems thrive.”<br></em>A’krozni bends down and looks at the small insects burrowing in the dirt.<br>Four people come from different directions to check out what had happened, but the moment they see the old man checking out their pots, they return to their stations.<br><em>“Should I tell them to give special attention to the little things?”<br>“Nah, their numbers won’t grow, the individuals will be healthier.”<br></em>Vezirva has a satisfied smile on her. She had thought of this mutation a couple of years back, but never really had the opportunity to use it.<br><em>“When does the market place open up?”<br></em>She has a general idea of how many of his kids live at the house, and she wants to get them something.<br>She couldn’t help but pick up on it as her instincts don’t come with a turn off button.
