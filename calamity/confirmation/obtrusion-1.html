                In very deep space, where the closest galaxy cluster is several billion lightyears away, somewhere closer to the centre of the universe where no solid ground resides anymore, floats away a wooden door frame attached to nothing.<br>The finely crafted mahogany doors slide open to show a bright room inside.<br>The grey cat steps on small pink light platforms that appear under its paws as it moves. It jumps into the door and flips so it's no longer upside down.<br>It makes its way between the labyrinth of shelves full of books, slabs, servers, bottles, and all sorts of other miscellaneous items. The floors, stairs, and ceilings are also shelves holding their contents with a small gravity field. The library wasn’t designed to be a maze or confuse people, but the owner never took into consideration the possibility of other people actually using it. The cat, on the other hand, moves between the long corridors with the finesse and agility of… a cat….<br>While going to its destination, the cat passed by many doors kilometres away from each other, like the one it used to walk in here, but it only stopped in front of one. The only door to have engravings on it; “The Overseer” it said.<br>Behind it is a small office space, with a desk in the middle and a few cabinets full of decorations. Ancient paintings all over the wall and antique vases, a grandfather clock, an old looking pickaxe, modern art, a gif in the form of an actual painting, and even anime and videogame figures. The desk has a holographic screen with paper on top of the projected keyboard, alongside an ink pot and a quill.<br>Behind the desk sits a small girl that looks to be in her twenties with a long pink pigtail. She wears silver frame glasses that cover 2 of her 7 eyes. Each of her eyes have a different type of iris within it, and every time she blinks, some of the irises change at random, while the central one on her forehead is closed. Even though she has 7 eyes, it still somehow fits all together with her face and emits a radiant cuteness around her.

                <em>“You can’t impose your judgement on me," </em>she says sternly with a heavy heart.<br>The cat jumps on the desk and walks through the screen to sit on her papers.<br><em>“I’m aware of my own future, I was the one that started it." </em>She looks down shyly.<br>The cat turns its head.<br><em>“Unlike you, I’m bound to this one chain, only you have the luxury of walking through the branches."<br></em>The cat walks up to a cup on the desk and starts to drink some water.<br>She lets out a sigh. <em>“Of course I have that authority… Plus, we won’t mind, we’re adept at our job."<br></em>The cat starts to lick its paw.<br><em>“Well, retirement wouldn’t be so bad, I would choose it any day!” </em>she says with a melancholic look on her.<br>The cat hisses at her.<br><em>“Never," </em>she says with the saddest of smiles.<em><br></em>The cat steps closer to sit right in front of the girl.<br><em>“If they decide they don’t need me, then who am I to judge?”</em> She strokes the cat.<br>The cat purrs in return.<br><em>“I’ll only be a burden if I do…” </em>she truly believes she would be. She never learnt to ask for help even after billions of years with billions of people coming to ask her for her help.<br><em>“I’ll accompany you once your time comes," </em>says a very deep and old wise voice inside of the girl’s head as the cat purrs between her hands.
